## Project Overview

The California School District Financial Data Explorer is a web-based application designed to make California school district financial data **accessible, searchable, and interactive** for researchers, educators, and policymakers.

Public education finance data is often fragmented across multiple state sources and difficult to work with at scale. This project integrates datasets from the California Department of Education and the State Controller’s Office into a unified, continuously updateable dataset, paired with an interactive visualization interface.

The application supports both **data exploration** and **data maintenance**, allowing authorized users to merge newly released public data and immediately reflect updates in the visualization tool.
